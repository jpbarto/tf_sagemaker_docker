"""Simple, end-to-end, LeNet-5-like convolutional MNIST model example.

This should achieve a test error of 0.7%. Please keep this model as simple and
linear as possible, it is meant as a tutorial for simple convolutional models.
Run with --self_test on the command line to execute a short self-test.
